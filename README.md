A basic library for Lie Theory, focused on robotics. It contains the most important Lie groups/manifolds used in robotics and estimation. It implements useful functionalities for the rotation groups S1, S3, SO2 and SO3, the rigid motion groups SE2 and SE3, and the translation group T. It calculates a variety of lie operations (plus and minus operators, adjoints, right and left jacobians, etc.) for all the mentioned groups.

I was inspired by this paper: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1812.01537
